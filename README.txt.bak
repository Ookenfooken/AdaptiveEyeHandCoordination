This repository contains script to view and process data collected in a project on 
adaptive eye-hand coordination when manipulating and monitoring the environment in parallel

- ExperimentInfo.xlsx
Contains relevant information about variables in the raw data, coordinates of the landmarks, and how kinematic phases were classified

- dropList.csv
Contains information in order of participant ID, block ID, and trial ID of trials, in which the ball was dropped 
(determined by visual inspection)

- createMatFiles.m
Converts raw eye and hand movement data into matlab structures that are used for all further analysis. 

- createDisplayFiles.m
Converts raw vigilance task data into matlab structures that are used for all further analysis. 

- visualizeData.m
Allows to view eye and hand movement data for each participant and trial. 
Requires prepareData.m, plotData.m, createBallVector.m, and gazePositionRaw.m

- pullExperimentInfo.m
Saves relevant trial information into more descriptive data format (pulledData.mat) that is used for further analysis
Requires pullDataTrial.m, readoutTrialInfo.m, readoutGaze.m, readoutEffector.m, readoutVigilanceTask
